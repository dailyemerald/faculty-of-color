    <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past seven years, the University of Oregon has had among the lowest percentages of faculty of color out of the 64 universities in the Association of American Universities. Between 2005 and 2012, the UO ranked the lowest. This year, it is the fourth from the bottom, with 14 percent compared to the average 21. 

    Recruiting and retaining faculty of color has been a historical issue for the UO. Low numbers have created what many say is a hostile climate and caused diverse faculty to feel isolated and out of place in a community of TKTK faculty members. The dominantly white environment has caused many faculty members to leave the UO for other universities, making it more difficult for the UO to increase the percentage of diverse faculty.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ernesto Martinez, an ethnic studies professor and author of the book &quotThe Truly Diverse Faculty,&quot says that schools lacking diversity often have hostile environments for community members of color, often leading to feelings of isolation such as 
    Karim&#8217;s.
    
    &quotMajority white communities are often hostile places,&quot Martinez said. &quotWhen you don&#8217;t see faculty of color like you, it becomes harder to imagine whether people like you should be there at all.&quot 

    Issues like these have led to a low retention rate among faculty of color. Though the UO keeps no records on retention, Daniel Hosang, the director of the Center of Diversity and Community says that the UO struggles to keep faculty of color for more than five years.

    <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though some left for higher paying jobs at more competitive universities, many left due to the racial climate on campus. Lynn Fujiwara, who has worked at the UO since YEAR, has seen many faculty members of color come and go. 

    &quotI had several colleagues of color and they all left,&quot Fujiwara said. &quotWhat we had was called a revolving door. The university does a fairly good job of recruiting faculty, but they get here and it&#8217;s so alienating and tokenizing when you&#8217;re the only faculty of color in your department.&quot

    Discussions surrounding diversity at the UO in the past 15 years have been steeped in controversy. Oregon has had historically low numbers of faculty of color, due in part to its comparatively low salaries and lack of active recruiting. When numbers are already low, however, it becomes even more difficult to recruit and retain diverse faculty. Without critical mass, Hosang says, less diverse schools like UO often lose minority faculty to schools that have larger communities. 

     &quotThere&#8217;s a little chicken and egg to it,&quot Hosang said. &quotThe challenge isn&#8217;t getting people in the door but getting them to stay.&quot

    <p class="text" id="afterGr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, 75 students and faculty protested in Johnson Hall, demanding increased diversity among faculty on campus, and 31 were arrested for refusing to leave the building. After conversations with then-president David Frohnmayer, the students requested a diversity office be created. That request was fulfilled in 2006, after faculty member Joe Wade filed a discrimination lawsuit against the University. In 2006, the university made national headlines when it lost two prominent faculty members following accusations of a racially biased hiring process for the law school dean. 

    The controversies led the UO to hire an outside researcher to put together a report on the racial climate in 2002. The report found XXXXX. 

    To solve the problems, Scott Coltrane, former dean of the college of arts and sciences and current interim president of the university, worked to departmentalize specific disciplines like ethnic studies to help retain faculty of color. 

    This shift gave these departments power to give their own faculty tenure, which increased retention.

    <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Doug Blandy has led the charge to actively recruit faculty of color. Since YEAR, recruiting has been expanded to involve going to conferences to approach and interview candidates and bringing candidates to Oregon. Since 2006, the UO has spent $23,786 on recruiting faculty, an increase of XXX since the diversity plan.

    The efforts are apparent in the the rising numbers of faculty of color.

    However, there is still work to be done. 

    &quotIt has improved.&quot Karim said. &quotIt can improve a lot more.&quot

    Being one of few minority members can leave colored faculty to feel as though they are pushed into one group and their individual needs become ignored.
</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karim says when new faculty of color is hired it is common for them to feel pressure from the university to represent themselves across several boards. 

    &quotIf you come in and you find that you know you are being used you&#8217;re sort of like the diversity person and you&#8217;re put in front of each and every diversity committee,&quot Kasim said. &quotIn the past they didn&#8217;t do a good job of welcoming people and looking at the needs of faculty. Everyone is from the same cookie cutter, people have different kinds of needs.&quot  


    Professors getting tenure

    According to Lynn Fujiwara, founding member and coordinator of the women of color faculty group founded in 2008, associate professors gaining tenure has been an issue for the university in retaining faculty of color. 

    Fujiwara described women and gender studies as her &quothome&quot at the university, but she wasn&#8217;t able to gain tenure in this discipline, because it wasn&#8217;t a department, and faculty could only be tenured in a department. This forced other directors from separate departments to tenure faculty in such disciplines, taking the voice away from program&#8217;s such as Lynn&#8217;s. 
</br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she began creating the women of colored faculty group, helping junior/associate professors gain tenure was a top priority. 

    &quotRetention was really bad. The point of it (the group) was trying to develop a feeling of a cohort, trying to develop the feeling of a community while also providing support and mentorship for doing what we needed to do to get tenure and be successful, and want to stay.&quot Fujiwara said.

    Fujiwara said since the group began, they have taken on more than ten junior professors, and currently over half of them have gained tenure. 

    Fujiwara said that Scott Coltrane, former dean of the college of arts and sciences and current interim president of the university, made a shift in his early years to help retain faculty of color by departmentalizing specific disciplines. 

    Some disciplines he departmentalized include women&#8217;s and gender studies as well as ethnic studies. This shift gave these departments power to give their own faculty tenure, which increased retention. (contribute)
