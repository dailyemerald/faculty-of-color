    <p class="text" id="first">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past seven years, the University of Oregon has had among the lowest percentages of faculty of color out of the 64 universities in the Association of American Universities. Between 2005 and 2012, the UO ranked the lowest. This year, it is the fourth from the bottom, with 14 percent compared to the average 21. Recruiting and retaining faculty of color has been a historical issue for the UO. Low numbers have created what many say is a hostile climate and caused diverse faculty to feel isolated and out of place in a community of TKTK faculty members. The dominantly white environment has caused many faculty members to leave the UO for other universities, making it more difficult for the UO to increase the percentage of diverse faculty.

    <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lamia Karim came to the University of Oregon, she was one of the few South Asian faculty members on campus. The Bangladeshi native came to the United States in 1980, when her country was under military rule, and she arrived at the UO from Massachusetts in 2003. As one of the few faculty of color on campus, she felt isolated and marginalized in a dominantly white community. &quotIt was very lonely, Karim said. &quotThere were very few of us.&quot She found a sense of community with a small group of other minority faculty. Today, she is a tenured anthropology professor at the UO. Although Karim was able to build her career here, her story is the exception rather than the rule.

    Despite an ambitious minority recruiting program, UO struggles to retain faculty of color, a situation that directly affects its students. UO&#39;s increasing number of minority students are deprived of mentors and inspirations, and the general student body is deprived of the variety of classes and research that minority faculty bring to a college campus, experts say. For the past seven years, the University of Oregon has had among the lowest percentages of faculty of color out of the 64 universities in the Association of American Universities. Between 2005 and 2012, the UO ranked the lowest. Although it moved up the rankings this year to fourth from the bottom, minority faculty at the UO still only represent 14 percent of the total faculty. The average among AAU schools is 21 percent. Since 2011 the UO has poured over $1 million into recruiting diverse faculty. But the percentage has only shifted 1 percentage point in those three years, and the university has consistently lagged behind the AAU average by 6 to 7 percentage points since 2005. Ernesto Martinez, a UO ethnic studies professor and author of the book &quotThe Truly Diverse Faculty,&quot says that schools lacking diversity often have unwelcoming environments for university staff and faculty of color, leading to feelings of isolation such as Karim&#39;s. &quotMajority white communities are often hostile places,&quot Martinez said. &quotWhen you don&#39;t see faculty of color like you, it becomes harder to imagine whether people like you should be there at all.&quot Though some argue that less diverse states like Oregon will naturally have less diverse universities, Martinez says that this is irrelevant because faculty are recruited from across the nation. &quotThat just rationalizes places to stay non-diverse,&quot he said. A non-diverse faculty can also hurt students â€“ particularly students of color, Martinez said. The university&#39;s proportion of students of color has increased to 27 percent, the highest in the its history. Martinez said it can be harmful when students don&#39;t see faculty members of the same race represented on campus. &quotStudents need to be able to visualize themselves,&quot Martinez said. &quotPart of having a diverse faculty is to provide these students with the tools they need. When you don&#39;t see yourself anywhere, it can be a place to say &#39;peace out.&#39;&quot The university has struggled for 15 years to increase the diversity of its faculty. In 1999, 75 students and faculty protested in Johnson Hall, demanding increased diversity among faculty on campus. Thirty-one were arrested for refusing to leave the building. After conversations with then-president David Frohnmayer, the students requested a diversity office be created. In 2001, faculty member Joe Wade filed a discrimination lawsuit against the University, which was settled in 2002 with an agreement that the UO would hire a vice provost for institutional diversity. (UO administration told the Daily Emerald in 200X that they intended to create the position before the lawsuit.) The controversies led the UO to hire an independent researcher to compile a report on the racial climate in 2002. The report found XXXXX. (Waiting for UO to send me the report) In 2006, the university made national headlines when two prominent faculty members left the university in protest of an allegedly racially biased hiring process for the law school dean. The same year, the UO created a campuswide diversity plan, resolving to increase faculty diversity and to dedicate more money to hiring and retaining faculty of color. The UO has historically struggled with recruiting faculty of color. Low salaries make the university less appealing to faculty in general -- in 2006, UO paid 33 percent less than the average AAU institution. Salaries continue to lag behind -- today, UO salaries are 13 percent less than the average AAU salary. The university has also failed to build a diverse candidate pool. The university historically has not actively recruited candidates through networking at conferences or by inviting candidates to tour the UO campus. This has put the UO at a disadvantage to other universities that take advantage of these opportunities. Retaining faculty, however, has been the biggest battle. When numbers are already low, it becomes even more difficult to recruit and retain diverse faculty. Daniel Hosang, director of the Center for Community and Diversity, said less diverse schools like UO often lose minority faculty to schools that have larger minority communities. &quotThere&#39;s a little chicken and egg to it,&quot Hosang said. &quotThe challenge isn&#39;t getting people in the door but getting them to stay.&quot Many diverse faculty members will also leave the university if they don&#39;t receive tenure. According to Vice President of Equity and Inclusion Yvette Alex-Assensoh, faculty of color are often overlooked for tenure because of their focuses of study. The UO needs to consider new ways of evaluating faculty for promotion to make the process more inclusive, Alex-Assensoh said. &quotMany of them engage in research at the intersection of disciplines,&quot Alex-Assensoh said. &quotHow do we assess that when it comes time for promotion?&quot Scott Coltrane, former dean of the college of arts and sciences and current interim president of the university, tried to address the issue by departmentalizing specific disciplines, such as ethnic studies, to help retain faculty of color. This shift gave these departments power to give their own faculty tenure, which increased retention, according Hosang and other faculty members. The university does not keep records on faculty retention, but university budgets show there&#39;s been an increased effort has been to recruit more diverse faculty. Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Doug Blandy has led the charge to actively recruit faculty of color. This year, the Office for Academic Affairs established a $23,786 fund to to travel to conferences and universities with potential candidates and to bring them to campus. Though it hasn&#39;t brought new faculty to campus yet, the campaign helps the UO builds its pool of future faculty members, Blandy said. &quotWe&#39;re very optimistic about what the effects will be,&quot Blandy said. &quotIt&#39;s been successful in permitting departments to cultivate possible hires and communicating that the UO is committed to diversifying.&quot The UO has also dedicated over $1 million over the past three years to its Underrepresented Minority Recruitment Fund, which provides money to support new minority faculty members. Even with these efforts, the UO&#39;s overall percentage of faculty of color has only grown by 3 percentage points in the last nine years -- from 11 percent in the 2005-2006 school year to 14 percent last year. However, more of UO&#39;s tenure track faculty is diverse -- over 25 percent of them are faculty of color according to 2014 data, compared to 11 percent in the 2005-2006 school year. Blandy says this is progress, as most of the hiring that will take place over the next 10 years will be among tenure-track faculty. &quotI think you can see the effects,&quot Blandy said. &quotWe&#39;re not where we need to be, but we are on the right trajectory. We need to be continually engaged with actively recruiting a diverse faculty.&quot However, Blandy, Hosang and Alex-Assensoh agree that there is still work to be done. This fall, Coltrane announced the UO&#39;s plan to hire 150 new faculty members over the next five years, along with an announcement that the UO needs to make diversity a priority with a new campuswide diversity plan, set to be unveiled this year. Alex-Assensoh believes that now is the right time for the UO to ask itself what needs to be done to reach its goal of having more diversity -- and she believes it begins with having a specific goal. Alex-Assensoh believes the university needs to set a specific goal for diversity. &quot&#39;What do we aspire to be?&#39; It&#39;s an ideal time to ask that question,&quot she said. &quotIt&#39;s not enough to say we want to have a more diverse faculty.&quot That sentiment is shared by faculty members, including Karim. &quotIt has improved,&quot Karim said. &quotIt can improve a lot more.&quot
