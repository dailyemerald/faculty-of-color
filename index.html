    <p class="text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past seven years, the University of Oregon has had among the lowest percentages of faculty of color out of the 64 universities in the Association of American Universities. Between 2005 and 2012, the UO ranked the lowest. This year, it is the fourth from the bottom, with 14 percent compared to the average 21. Recruiting and retaining faculty of color has been a historical issue for the UO. Low numbers have created what many say is a hostile climate and caused diverse faculty to feel isolated and out of place in a community of TKTK faculty members. The lack of a community has caused many faculty members to leave the UO for other universities, causing administration difficulty in shifting position in the AAU/increasing percentage/climbing back from the bottom. QUOTE FROM ADMIN ON HOW THIS IS A SUCKY SITUATION</p>

    <p class="text">Lamia Karim, a TKTK professor believes that it is easy to get lost as a colored faculty member in a university as large as the UO. She began at the university in 2003 and spoke of times in which she felt very lonely and isolated among a dominantly white culture. &quot it was very lonely, you know there were very few of us, the good part of it the few of us that were there formed a cohort group more easily.&quot Ernesto Martinez, a TK TK professor and author of the book The Truly Diverse Faculty, says that having few faculty of color can lead to a more hostile work environment for minorities. When there are only a few with minority status, he said, it puts more pressure on those who are there to tackle diversity issues alone. QUOTE, Martinez says.</p>
    <p class="text">This type of pressure to represent the bulk of minority issues can leave colored faculty to feel as though they are pushed into one group and their individual needs are become ignored. Kasim says when new faculty of color is hired it is common for them to feel pressure from the university to represent themselves across several boards. &quotIf you come in and you find that you know you are being used you’re sort of like the diversity person and you’re put in front of each and every diversity committee,&quot Kasim said. &quot In the past they didn’t do a good job of welcoming people and looking at the needs of faculty. Everyone is from the same cookie cutter, people have different kinds of needs. &quot</p>

    <p class="text">Professors trying to get tenure: Alex According to Lynne Fujiwara, head director for ethnic studies and director of the women of color faculty group, having professors get tenure was a top priority when the group was getting started. Fujiwara said that when the group of women began writing the proposal to form the group, there were only five associate professors on campus. Fujiwara had just received tenure. The group was home for ten junior women, and over half of them are currently tenured. &quotRetention was really bad. The point of it was trying to develop a feeling of a cohort, trying to develop the feeling of a community while also providing support and mentorship for doing what we needed to do to get tenure and be successful, and want to stay.&quot We pulled together 10 junior women, and over half of them are already tenured senior vice provost for academic affairs who came and talked about getting tenure When Coltrane was in his primary position as Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, he helped provide a lot of support for interdisciplinary programs. Before this shift interdisciplinary programs struggled to gain legitimacy at the university, and were not allowed to tenure their own faculty. &quot we were not really seen as legitmate fields, we were sub fields.&quot Fujiwara said. &quot In fact we couldn't even tenure our own faculty, they wanted a department to tenure us. So we had no power over our own selves in that sense.&quot For Fujiwara and colleuges, their homes were in their programs, such as ethnic studies, women’s and gender studies, ect. But their tenure homes were departments like sociology or english or history or anthropology Interdisciplinary programs are often not seen as disciplines</p>
